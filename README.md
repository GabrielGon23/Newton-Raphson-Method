# Description:
Algorithm that implements the Newton-Raphson method, shows the error relative to each iteration, value of the function and the approximation of the root at each iteration, in addition to plotting the error approximation graph in relation to the desired approximation.
 
In the Newton-Raphson method an initial approximation is used, the equation of the tangent line to the graph of the function is calculated by means of the derivative,
so that the iterations approach the root with : X(k+1) = X(k) - f(x(k)) / f'(x(k)))
